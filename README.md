# React Redux OnseUI 2 Cordova Starter App

Starter App using Onsen UI, Redux, React, Cordova and Webpack.

This Starter App is a copy of [react-onsenui-redux-weather](https://github.com/argelius/react-onsenui-redux-weather) adding the Cordova Part. The idea here is have some example code on how to start the app using these technologies.

- [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io/), a hybrid app framework that provides both Material Design and iOS flat design.

- It uses [CrossWalk](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview)

## How to run it

To run it simply do:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will run at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

- [Install Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#installing-the-cordova-cli):
